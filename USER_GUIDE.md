## For Dealers and Sales Staff: Driver Selection

### How to Select Drivers with Preferences

When creating a new delivery request, you'll now see an enhanced driver selection interface:

1. **Click the "Select Driver" button** instead of using a dropdown
2. **Search for drivers** by name or vehicle type using the search bar
3. **Sort drivers** by your preference:
   - **My Preferences**: Drivers you've used and rated highly appear first
   - **Top Performers**: Drivers with best completion rates and on-time delivery
   - **Recently Used**: Drivers you've worked with most recently
   - **Alphabetical**: Sort by name

4. **View driver information**:
   - ⭐ Star ratings show your preference level
   - 📊 Performance metrics (completed deliveries, success rate)
   - 🔄 Usage count (how many times you've selected them)
   - ✅ Favorite badge for highly-rated drivers

5. **Select a driver** by clicking on their card
6. **Leave unassigned** if you want all available drivers notified

### Understanding Driver Metrics

- **Completed Deliveries**: Total successful deliveries for your dealership

## For Drivers: Dealership Organization

### Working with Multiple Dealerships

When you work for multiple dealerships, SwapRunn helps you stay organized:

1. **Color-Coded Requests**: Each dealership has a unique color
   - Left border of request cards matches dealership color
   - Dealership badge uses the same color
   - Accept button uses dealership's color

2. **Dealership Filter Bar**:
   - Appears at the top when you work with 2+ dealerships
   - Shows all dealerships with active request counts
   - Click a dealership to see only their requests
   - Click "All Dealerships" to see everything

3. **Visual Organization**:
   - 🏢 Building icon next to dealership name
   - 🕒 Time indicator shows how long ago request was posted
   - Color-coded throughout for quick identification

### Tips for Efficiency

## For Everyone: Rating System

2. **Select 1-5 stars** based on experience:
   - ⭐ 1 Star: Needs Improvement
   - ⭐⭐ 2 Stars: Fair
   - ⭐⭐⭐ 3 Stars: Good
   - ⭐⭐⭐⭐ 4 Stars: Great
   - ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ 5 Stars: Excellent

3. **Your rating helps**:

### Q: What if a driver works for multiple dealerships I use?
**A:** Your preferences are tracked per dealership, so you can rate the same driver differently at different dealerships.
